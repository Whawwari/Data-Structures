IMPLEENTATION
the functionality of this code is complete, it should be able to store the files as asked for in all cases. The only thing i wish i had time to improve was the user interface.

WHAT I LEARNT
I learned how and what a linked list is. Although i understood its concept this was my first time interacting with them. I learnt how to create a expanding array as well. finally i got more experience and felt alot more comfortable with the make file.
