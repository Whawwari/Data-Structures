IMPLENTATION:

The functionality of this code is complete.

SUMMARY OF CODE:

In this project, I developed a hashing algorithm designed for rapid data retrieval and storage, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. To address collisions, I incorporated linear, quadratic, and double hashing probes. The program is structured to allocate memory dynamically for each new entry and to release it appropriately when the data is no longer required. I also implemented a mechanism for efficient data removal, allowing the reclaimed space to be reused. I tested the code for memory leaks using Valgrind.
