# Associative arrays implemented using tries

## Name:
## ID:

This `README.md` file describes an implementation of associative
arrays using *tries*, and evaluates when these are superior to
the use of a *hash table* based implementation.

# Summary

## Conditions that would make a hash table appropriate:

Choose a hash table when *ALL* of the conditions in the **required**
list are true and any of the conditions in the **preferred** list
are true.

are true.
